Make a Web site on your github.io account or your personal public_html folder on myy. If you publish your website on your own domain, such as www.kaspervaltakari.com, that is great! You need to choose the topic yourself. 

Your web site should have about 5 interlinked web pages. Five is the minimum number of pages. Do not use more than 8 pages. Use 2-4 different layouts, preferably grid and flexbox. If possible, select the page layout that best supports the content of the page. 

Your first page should be a simple homepage or start page or landing page (dear child has many names). This page should be the start page of your site. Link all pages and provide link back to home. Other about 4 pages you choose yourself based on your topic. Name the pages in your own way. Use descriptive but short name. Remember technical naming conventions. Do not call them Page1.html etc. Contact information, History, Products, Services, About us, Why us, Our collaborator (companies), We on the social media, you name it. 

Have fun!
